- [ ] new uobject 的 构造函数

> error C2338: You have to define MyUObject::MyUObject() or MyUObject::MyUObject(const FObjectInitializer&). This is required by UObject system to work correctly.

There is no way to create custom constructors for UObjects, or pass parameters through NewObject. An Init() function (or public variables and direct assignment) is currently the way to go, even if it isn’t very pretty.


- [ ] bp class mark abstract

在 bp 中定义的变量，默认是 bp read write 的

- [ ] asset 和 uobject reference 的关系


- [ ] lua module keyword


angelscript 介于 cpp 和bp之间的中间层
